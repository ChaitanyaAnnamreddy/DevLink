# Production deployment manually (frontend deployment process)

- create a AWS account - https://aws.amazon.com/ (it will ask for credit card details. in the final step select Basic support - Free)
- Then go to aws console -> EC2 -> Launch Instance
- we should create a new EC2 instance or virtual machine
- give a name to your instance
- select the OS - use any OS - i used ubuntu
- scroll down -> select the type of instance - i used t2.micro
- key pair - create a new key pair - name anything - download the public key
- click on launch instance
- wait for the instance to get ready
- connect to your instance
- click on SSH client
- go to terminal or command prompt - go to the folder where the key is downloaded(ex: cd downloads in mycase)
- give the command - chmod 400 <key-file-name>.pem (changing the permision of our secret key)
- give the command - ssh -i <key-file-name>.pem ubuntu@<instance-public-ip> (connecting to our instance using the key)
- once you are in your ubunto maching - install nodejs - curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
- close the terminal and reopen, make sure you are in the folder where your key is present
- Download and install Node.js:
- nvm install 22(this version should match your local node version)
- check
  - node -v,
  - npm -v
- Then clone the frontend code - git clone https://github.com/ChaitanyaAnnamreddy/DevLink.git
- similarly clone the backend code - git clone https://github.com/ChaitanyaAnnamreddy/devLink-backend.git
- then run command ls - you should see two folders - DevLink and devLink-backend
- in your local make sure your frontend code is build - npm run build
- cd into DevLink
  - npm install
  - npm run build
  - run command ls and you should see the file - dist
  - run sudo apt update - this will update the package list
  - run sudo apt install nginx - this will install nginx
  - run sudo systemctl start nginx - this will start the nginx on to our system
  - run sudo systemctl enable nginx - this will enable the nginx on to our system
  - copy code from dist folder(build files) to /var/www/html - run sudo scp -r dist/\* /var/www/html
  - run cd /var/www/html - all the built files are now present in the html folder
- ![alt text](image.png) - now go to aws instance and click on security group
- ![alt text](image-1.png) - click edit inbound rules - then click add rule
- ![alt text](image-2.png) - in port range give 80 and source as 0.0.0.0/0 - click save rules
- ![alt text](image-3.png) - you should be able to see port range 80
- ![alt text](image-4.png) - copy the public ip and paste it in the browser - you should see the frontend running
